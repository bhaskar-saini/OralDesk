## Project Structure

- Assets - Icons and Images
- Components/Admin - Holds all admin reusable components
- Pages - Handle Login and Dashboards
- context - Handles simulated authentication and user roles
- App - Main App component
- index.css - Tailwind CSS + global styles

## Common Issues
- Form default behaviour of submit - handle use e.preventDefault ()
- Importing fonts after the tailwind utilities gives an error
- Appointments not showing for patient - Ensure user.id === appointment.pid as string comparison
- Files not downloading correctly - Convert file to base64 on upload and reconstruct via data: URL
- Sidebar breaking layout on small screens - Sidebar set to hidden sm:flex and toggled only on sm and above
- Empty data on refresh - Ensure localStorage is populated and check JSON parsing logic
